# Purpose
The Chesapeake Digital Humanities Consortium (CDHC) is an association of people and institutions committed to the cooperative development of teaching, learning, research, and community partnerships in the digital humanities. Because place and space shape collaboration, CDHC is focused on supporting digital humanities in the D.C, Virginia, and Maryland region. 

CDHC has three guiding goals:
* Identifying, developing, and communicating opportunities for members to pursue the digital humanities. 
* Building accessible, diverse, and equitable digital humanities communities. 
* Fostering sharing, collaboration, and innovation among people, places, and institutions.

# Membership

# History
With the help of funding from the Associated Colleges of the South and University of Virginia Scholarsâ€™ Lab, the Consortium [formed in March 2018](http://symposium.scholarslab.org/) to encourage collaboration across liberal arts colleges and Carnegie classification Research I universities. The scope quickly expanded to focus on people, rather than institutions, in the Washington D.C, Maryland, and Virginia region. 

On May 29, 2019, a [group met at the University of Richmond](https://github.com/nolauren/workshops/blob/master/cheasepeake.md) to solidify the consortium.
