[Dr. Amanda French](https://amandafrench.net/) will be keynoting CDHC 2021!

Dr. French is the Community Lead and Data Entry Shift Lead at The COVID Tracking Project.

[The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) is a volunteer organization launched from The Atlantic and dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.  Every day, they collect data on COVID-19 testing and patient outcomes from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Their dataset is currently in use by national and local news organizations across the United States and by research projects and agencies worldwide. Their data API (which allows sites and apps to import our dataset automatically) receives about two million requests per day. On April 15, they launched the COVID Racial Data Tracker, a partnership between the COVID Tracking Project and the Center for Antiracist Research that collects, publishes, and analyzes racial data on the pandemic within the United States.

### Proposal Types and Lengths
All proposal abstracts should address 1) the research/pedagogical significance of the project, and 2) the platform or tool used in the project.

- **20-minute Individual Presentation**: Please provide an abstract of 250 words and a brief bio (75 words).

- **1-hour Panel**: Panels feature individual presentations organized around a common topic. Please provide a panel rationale of no more than 300 words, with individual presentation abstracts (150-300 words) for up to five participants. Include titles and institutional affiliations for each participant. Only one person should submit abstracts on the panel’s behalf. (note: students should specify their institutional status).

- **5-minute Lightning Round**: Please submit a 100-word description on a topic you would like to discuss.

- **45-minute How I Made This**: In these show-and-tell sessions, members of the DH community will introduce you to their projects in a more practically-minded manner, with an opportunity for a robust conversation following. These sessions, which may foreground long-term research projects, small DH initiatives, or pedagogical projects, should be developed with an eye towards helping conference participants get a handle on the kinds of resources available, projects in development, and opportunities for collaboration and community-building. What was your goal or guiding question? What theoretical or contextual approaches framed your work? What tools did you use? What failures did you encounter, and what did you learn from them? What did you find successful? Did you pursue grants, and if so, how did you go about that? How does the project employ collaborators? How did you find institutional support? What is the next step for the project? Session leaders may elect to run a hands-on workshop, but proposals should bear in mind technological and geographical limitations. Sessions should not be organized around traditional papers. Each show-and-tell session is 45 minutes in length, with at least half of the time reserved for discussion or Q&A.  Please submit a 150-word description and rationale of and for your proposed workshop, and indicate whether your workshop would be beginner, intermediate, or advanced.

If you have any questions, please contact chesapeakedhconsortium@gmail.com.
